    "A electronics company considers to enter the smartphone market. To better understand the importance of attributes, such as Cost, Size, Memory storage, Camera quality and Operating System (OS) it has hired a high-end consultant to figure out how important these attributes are to consumers of different age groups and genders.  Therefore, the consultant has conducted a Stated Choice experiment, in which participants faced 16 hypothetical choice tasks. The screenshot below shows one of the choice tasks. Besides the choice tasks, participants were asked about their age and gender. The data collection has just finished. In total 125, participants have completed the experiment.<br>\n",
