The exam will take place in one of TUDâ€™s computer halls, and you will complete it on a university computer. You can access Jupyter Notebook, Python, Excel, and Notepad in the digital exam environment. You cannot access the internet, ChatGPT or any other online resource.

Partial exam 1 aims to assess your modelling skills, not your Python syntax knowledge. <br>
Therefore, we will provide you with the following files during the exam:
- All [Lab session notebooks](Partial_exam/lab_sessions_html) with the correct answers provided by us (in HTML format)
- All [tutorial notebooks](Partial_exam/tutorials_html) (in HTML format)
- [Chi-square table](Partial_exam/ChiSquareDistribution.pdf) (pdf)
- [Formula cheat sheet](Partial_exam/Formula%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf) (pdf) (although I don't think you will need this)
<br><br>

The main focus of the exam lies on weeks 1 and 2 (MNL + Mixed Logit). You will not be asked to train a data-driven choice model (week 3). However, conceptual questions about week 3 can be part of the exam.

Note that the HTML files are not displaying on the GitHub website. Download the file and open it with a browser (or look at the pdf) to see it. You can also open the file in Jupyter Lab as a separate tab.
